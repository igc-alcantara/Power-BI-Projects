# Description

I recently attended the Zero to Low Code Dashboard: Power BI Desktop session hosted by DataSense Analytics and Coach Abs on March 15, 2025. This two-hour session provided me with a deeper understanding of Power BI, data analysis, and how to generate actionable insights through effective dashboard design.

One of the key lessons was the value of wireframing, a technique for sketching out the dashboard layout before diving into the details of visuals and widgets. This approach made it much easier to visualize the final design, speeding up the development process and ensuring a user-friendly layout. We also explored the basics of DAX (Data Analysis Expressions), creating a Calendar Table to enhance the analysis of financial data.

The session also emphasized the importance of clarity and organization in dashboard design, ensuring that insights are easily accessible and visually distinct to avoid overwhelming the user.

# Dashboard Analysis
For my first Power BI dashboard, I focused on simplicity and readability to deliver insights at a glance. Below is an analysis of the key components of the dashboard and the insights derived from it.

## 1. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
Total Revenue (2014): $118.73M, with a 7.74% growth compared to the previous month.

**Total Units Sold (2014):** 1.13M, showing a 6.08% growth.

**Total COGS (2014):** $101.83M, reflecting a 7.16% growth.

**Total Profit (2014):** $16.89M, with an 11.42% growth.

**Profit Margin (2014):** 14.23%, demonstrating a 3.42% increase.

These KPIs give a quick snapshot of the company’s financial health and its performance over time.

## 2. Monthly Revenue Trend: Peak & Low Sales (Cumulative)
The line chart shows revenue fluctuations across the months. The highest revenue of $21.67M occurred in October, while the lowest point of $5.59M was in December. This data indicates a strong peak season in the latter part of the year, likely tied to sales promotions or seasonal demand.

## 3. Profit Margin vs. Discount Rate
The dual-line chart reveals a direct correlation between discount rates and profit margins. It’s clear that discounts influence profit margins, with higher discount periods leading to decreased margins. This insight can help optimize pricing strategies and balance profitability with customer acquisition.

## 4. Revenue by Product
The horizontal bar chart showcases the top-performing products, with Paseo leading at $33M, followed by VTT at $21M, and Velo at $18M. This provides valuable insights into inventory management and can help prioritize marketing efforts for high-performing products.

## 5. Total COGS vs. Profit per Product
This bar chart compares the Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) and profitability for each product. Notably, Paseo has the highest revenue but also the highest COGS, indicating the need for better cost management. This comparison helps identify which products are performing well and which may need pricing adjustments or cost reductions.

# Conclusion
This Power BI dashboard serves as a solid foundation for data analysis, providing actionable insights into the company’s financial health, product performance, and pricing strategies. The session reinforced the importance of clarity, simplicity, and effective dashboard design in delivering insights that are easy to interpret and act upon.

Thanks to DataSense Analytics and Coach Abs for offering such an insightful and engaging session. I’m excited to continue applying these skills to create more meaningful and impactful dashboards in the future!
